## Hi there, I'm Rin 👋

> I do a little coding, a little spaghetti code, and a lot of questioning reality

---

### 🧠 cooking (aka fighting my 6GB VRAM GPU):
- 🧠 Uncensored local LLMs on toaster-tier hardware
- 🖥️ Making Windows look like Linux, cuz I Arch too hard and refuse to touch anything else. Check out [custom11](https://github.com/Rin-ngl/custom11)!

---

### 🌱 learning things i probably shouldn't be:
- 🤖 AI finetuning (because why use ChatGPT when you can build your own **shit machine™**)
- 🎨 UI/UX design, mostly me screaming while AI writes cursed CSS
- 🧼 Cleaning up 3am spaghetti code with 3% memory of writing it

---

### 🛠️ current arsenal:
- Languages: JavaScript, Python  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS  
- Backend: Node.js, Flask  
- Database: SQLite  
- AI/ML: Ollama, OpenRouter.ai *(because why pay everyone individually?)*  
- DevOps: Docker, Cloudflared  
- Tools: VS Code, Git, WSL, VMware  
- Package Managers: npm, pip  
- Shells: PowerShell, Bash  
- Cloud: Google Cloud *(when it stops rejecting my card 😤)*

---

### 🔥 fun facts:
- I can only code `print("hello world!")`... and even that needed two StackOverflow tabs
- My sleep schedule is nonexistent
- Pronouns: she/her or he/him
- I break stuff to learn... then forget how I fixed it

---

### 💬 hit me up if you're into:
- AI ethics + weird philosophy questions
- Actually into AI and wanna learn more about it and about local AI (I just know a lot about LLMs not other AIs)
- Tech rants at 2am with structure
- Hating on NVIDIA while buying more NVIDIA GPUs (it's a toxic relationship)
